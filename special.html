<h1><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Special Page!</h1>
<h4>Thoughts and Photos about my interests, the world, and life</h4>
<p>Basically the point of this page is to be uncontroversial and to give you something that I guarantee you will enjoy.  I want this page to be something you will come to on a daily basis.  I want this page to be something you will come to when you are sad, upset, or just have had a tough day.  I want this page to be something that will cheer you up and brighten your day!</p>
<p>This page was designed so that you don't have to be bombarded by the world about the latest and scandalous news.  If you want instant news, then this page is definitely not for you.  This page will not spoil things for you by telling you that for instance, "Michael Phelps has won another gold medal" before it is seen on primetime television by millions of people.  If you are not enjoying this page, then maybe I haven't updated this webpage often enough for you.</p>
<h4>First post on "My Special Page!" that actually means something</h4>
<p>So let's post something!  What you are about to see next is not something you will get angry over.  If it is, well, then...you need to go see a psychologist immediately (or you are not a human being)!  So scroll down and have a great day!  Then send the link to your friends and give them a reason to smile today!
