    <p>*For any team in which it indicates it last made the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament in the year "0", that really means it has never made the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament before.  Also, the list below is in alphabetical order (A-Z) by Conference name.</p>
    <p> {% for row in Teams %}
    {% if row.Team5 %}
    <strong>{{ row.Team5 }}</strong> is the 2014 {{ row.ConfChamps5 }} Conference Tournament Champions.  They are making their {{ row.Appearance5 }} appearance in the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament.  The last time they made the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament was in the year {{ row.Lastbid5|int }}.</p>

    <p><strong>Why should I even bother to watch the NCAA Tournament?</strong>  The NCAA Tournament is exciting and there are upsets every year.  However, the selection committee sometimes ranks the team with the worse winning percentage higher than the team with a better overall winning percentage.</p>
