  <h1>What teams <strong>SHOULD</strong> have got into the NCAA Tournament and what your bracket should (mostly) look like</h1>
  <p>Created by Evan Troxel.  <a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_Troxel">"Follow" me </a>on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter </a><a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_Troxel">@Evan_Troxel</a></p>
 <p><strong>All of these teams below DID make the NCAA Tournament, and they also had the top 64 or 68 overall winning percentages with one exception.  Providence was ranked 70th in overall winning percentage, but they had the same record (winning percentage) as Louisiana-Lafayette, Colorado, and BYU.  All of these teams below made the NCAA Tournament and definitely deserved to be in the NCAA Tournament:</strong></p> <p>   Wichita State has  34 Wins and 0 Losses.</p>   Florida has  32 Wins and 2 Losses.</p>   Stephen F. Austin has  31 Wins and 2 Losses.</p>   Arizona has  30 Wins and 4 Losses.</p>   San Diego State has  29 Wins and 4 Losses.</p>   Villanova has  28 Wins and 4 Losses.</p>   Harvard has  26 Wins and 4 Losses.</p>   Louisville has  29 Wins and 5 Losses.</p>   N.C. Central has  28 Wins and 5 Losses.</p>   Syracuse has  27 Wins and 5 Losses.</p>   Gonzaga has  28 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   Virginia has  28 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   Cincinnati has  27 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   New Mexico has  27 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   Saint Louis has  26 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   North Dakota St. has  25 Wins and 6 Losses.</p>   Wisconsin has  26 Wins and 7 Losses.</p>   Iowa State has  26 Wins and 7 Losses.</p>   Creighton has  26 Wins and 7 Losses.</p>   Manhattan has  25 Wins and 7 Losses.</p>   VCU has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   Mercer has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   Duke has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   UCLA has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   UConn has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   Michigan State has  26 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   Michigan has  25 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   George Washington has  24 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   Massachusetts (UMass) has  24 Wins and 8 Losses.</p>   New Mexico State has  26 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Ohio State has  25 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Delaware has  25 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Pittsburgh has  25 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Kansas has  24 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Eastern Kentucky has  24 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Saint Joseph&#39;s has  24 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Western Michigan has  23 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Memphis has  23 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   North Carolina has  23 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Oregon has  23 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Oklahoma has  23 Wins and 9 Losses.</p>   Kentucky has  24 Wins and 10 Losses.</p>   Texas has  23 Wins and 10 Losses.</p>   *Dayton has  23 Wins and 10 Losses.</p>   *Baylor has  24 Wins and 11 Losses.</p>   *Louisiana-Lafayette has  23 Wins and 11 Losses.</p>   *Colorado has  23 Wins and 11 Losses.</p>   *BYU has  23 Wins and 11 Losses.</p>   *Providence has  23 Wins and 11 Losses.</p>                                                                      
<p>*In my opinion, these teams would not have made the NCAA Tournament if they did not win their conference tournament or simply because their overall winning percentage wasn't in the top 36 winning percentages after the 32 conference tournament champions were already determined.</p>

   
   <p><strong>Teams who qualified for the NCAA Tournament by winning their conference tournament championship and probably wouldn't have got in if they didn't win it:</strong></p><p>  Albany</p>  American</p>  Cal Poly</p>  Coastal Carolina</p>  Louisiana-Lafayette</p>  Milwaukee</p>  Mount St. Mary&#39;s</p>  Providence</p>  Texas Southern</p>  Tulsa</p>  Weber State</p>  Wofford</p>                             
    
    
    
  

    <p><strong>To be objective, this is every team who I think should be in this year's NCAA Tournament.</strong> The teams listed below are teams who got an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament by winning their conference tournament championship (32 teams) or they got in because of their winning percentage was among the Top 36 remaining teams eligible to get into the Tournament who didn't already qualify for the Tournament.</p> <p>  Albany has 18 wins and 14 losses.</p>  American has 20 wins and 12 losses.</p>  Arizona has 30 wins and 4 losses.</p>  Belmont has 24 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Boston U. has 24 wins and 10 losses.</p>  Cal Poly has 13 wins and 19 losses.</p>  Cincinnati has 27 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Coastal Carolina has 21 wins and 12 losses.</p>  Creighton has 26 wins and 7 losses.</p>  Delaware has 25 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Duke has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Eastern Kentucky has 24 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Florida has 32 wins and 2 losses.</p>  George Washington has 24 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Georgia State has 25 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Gonzaga has 28 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Green Bay has 24 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Harvard has 26 wins and 4 losses.</p>  Iowa State has 26 wins and 7 losses.</p>  IPFW has 24 wins and 10 losses.</p>  Kansas has 24 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Kentucky has 24 wins and 10 losses.</p>  Louisiana Tech has 27 wins and 7 losses.</p>  Louisiana-Lafayette has 23 wins and 11 losses.</p>  Louisville has 29 wins and 5 losses.</p>  Manhattan has 25 wins and 7 losses.</p>  Massachusetts (UMass) has 24 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Memphis has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Mercer has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Michigan has 25 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Michigan State has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Middle Tennessee has 24 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Milwaukee has 21 wins and 13 losses.</p>  Mount St. Mary&#39;s has 16 wins and 16 losses.</p>  New Mexico has 27 wins and 6 losses.</p>  New Mexico State has 26 wins and 9 losses.</p>  North Carolina has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  North Carolina Central has 28 wins and 5 losses.</p>  North Dakota State has 25 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Ohio State has 25 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Oklahoma has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Oregon has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Pittsburgh has 25 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Princeton has 20 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Providence has 23 wins and 11 losses.</p>  Saint Joseph&#39;s has 24 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Saint Louis has 26 wins and 6 losses.</p>  San Diego State has 29 wins and 4 losses.</p>  Southern Methodist University (SMU) has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Southern Mississippi has 27 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Stephen F. Austin has 31 wins and 2 losses.</p>  Stony Brook has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  Syracuse has 27 wins and 5 losses.</p>  Texas has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  Texas Southern has 19 wins and 14 losses.</p>  Toledo has 27 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Tulsa has 21 wins and 12 losses.</p>  UC Santa Barbara has 21 wins and 9 losses.</p>  UCLA has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  UConn has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  VCU has 26 wins and 8 losses.</p>  Villanova has 28 wins and 4 losses.</p>  Virginia has 28 wins and 6 losses.</p>  Weber State has 19 wins and 11 losses.</p>  Western Michigan has 23 wins and 9 losses.</p>  Wichita State has 34 wins and 0 losses.</p>  Wisconsin has 26 wins and 7 losses.</p>  Wofford has 20 wins and 12 losses.</p>  *UTEP has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  *Indiana State has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  *Sam Houston State has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  *Dayton has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>  *Towson has 23 wins and 10 losses.</p>                                             
    <p>*UTEP, Indiana State, Sam Houston State, Dayton, and Towson had the same winning percentage as Stony Brook and Texas, but Stony Brook and Texas were ranked higher so they get into the Tournament and UTEP, Indiana State, Sam Houston State, Dayton, and Towson are the first five who don't get into the Tournament.</p>
    <p>Although this is obviously not perfect, the rankings for each team in each Region are correct and I tried to make each team most similar with the Region it is a part of geographically.  But this is a pretty good start.  I blame the NCAA Tournament people for naming regions before they are done selecting the teams that they have determined should be in the NCAA Tournament.  They can still name all the cities before the tournament to host tournament games though.  This is <strong>what your bracket SHOULD REALLY LOOK LIKE:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>East Region</strong></p></p> <p>  1 Florida </p>   16 American </p>   8 UConn </p>   9 Massachusetts </p>   5 Green Bay </p>   12 North Carolina </p>   4 Toledo </p>   13 Princeton </p>   6 Manhattan </p>   11 Saint Joseph&#39;s </p>   3 Syracuse </p>   14 Boston University </p>   7 VCU </p>   10 Pittsburgh </p>   2 Harvard </p>   15 Providence </p>          
    <p><strong>South Region</strong></p></p> <p>  1 Stephen F. Austin </p>   16 Wofford </p>   8 Georgia State </p>   9 George Washington </p>   5 Louisiana Tech </p>   12 SMU </p>   4 Southern Mississippi </p>   13 Oklahoma </p>   6 Creighton </p>   11 Eastern Kentucky </p>   3 NC Central </p>   14 Texas </p>   7 Mercer </p>   10 Delaware </p>   2 Villanova </p>   15 Coastal Carolina </p>          
    <p><strong>Midwest Region</strong></p><p>  1 Wichita State </p>   16 Milwaukee </p>   8 Duke </p>   9 Ohio State </p>   5 St. Louis </p>   12 Memphis </p>   4 Cincinnati </p>   13 Kentucky </p>   6 Wisconsin </p>   11 Western Michigan </p>   3 Virginia </p>   14 Stony Brook </p>   7 Michigan State </p>   10 Middle Tennessee </p>   2 Louisville </p>   15 Louisiana-Lafayette </p>          
    <p><strong>West Region</strong></p><p>  1 Arizona </p>   16 Weber State </p>   8 Michigan </p>   9 New Mexico State </p>   5 ND State </p>   12 Oregon </p>   4 New Mexico </p>   13 IPFW </p>   6 Iowa State </p>   11 Kansas </p>   3 Gonzaga </p>   14 UC Santa Barbara </p>   7 UCLA </p>   10 Belmont </p>   2 San Diego State </p>   15 Tulsa </p>          
    <p><strong>*The final four teams that will get into the NCAA Tournament in my opinion are: Mount St. Mary's, Albany, Cal Poly, and Texas Southern</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Why should I even bother to watch the NCAA Tournament?</strong>  The NCAA Tournament is exciting and there are upsets every year.  However, the selection committee sometimes ranks the team with the worse winning percentage higher than the team with a better overall winning percentage.</p>
