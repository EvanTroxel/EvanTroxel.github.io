  <h1>Analyzing the "Bubble Teams" of the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament (2013-2014 season)</h1>
  <p>Created by Evan Troxel.  <a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_Troxel">"Follow" me </a>on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter </a><a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_Troxel">@Evan_Troxel</a></p>
  <p><strong>NCAA Tournament HISTORY: </strong>Wichita State (34 Wins, 0 Losses) is the <strong>first team</strong> since UNLV in <strong>1991</strong> to go into the tournament undefeated.  Tournament Champions North Carolina Central University (MEAC) and Cal Poly (Big West) are making their first NCAA Division 1 Tournament appearance.  For the second time since 1973, no teams from the state of Indiana are in the tournament. </p>
<p>Before you look farther at this webpage, I have an obsession with the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament every year.  It's not just who plays who or who gets this or that ranking.  It's basically everything.  I wish the NCAA Selection Committee would get things right (but they DON'T)!  The NCAA Selection Committee cannot seem to get anything right when it comes to the Division 1 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, (as far as I'm concerned).</p>  <p>For example, the NCAA Selection Committee puts Spokane, Washington as part of the East Region for a second and third round game!  (Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  NOT!)  Spokane is in the WESTERN AND/OR NORTHERN United States!  Spokane is definitely not in the eastern part of the United States!</p>
    <p><strong>Why does overall record matter?</strong>  Overall record matters because to a degree it does say a lot about how good or bad of a team you are.  In some ways, overall record probably could be seen as an average record.</p>
    <p><strong>Why does conference record matter?</strong>  Conference record matters because if your team is winning many games against a tough opponent, it means your team is at least a good team.  Scoring lots on offense and not giving up a lot of points on defense is a sign of a good (maybe even a great team).</p>
 <p>So first you will see who the Conference Tournament Champions and Regular Season Conference Champions are for the 2013-14 season and then we will analyze who SHOULD and SHOULD NOT have made the 2013-14 NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament.  After that, I will make a case for a handful of teams that they deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament for the 2013-14 season.  At the end of my case for each team, I determine if the team actually deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament.  Finally, there are some charts at the bottom of this webpage about the handful of teams that I make a case for.</p>
  <p><a href="conftourc.html" >Conference Tournament Champions (2013-14 season)</a></p>
  <p><strong>Now, let's look at the Regular Season Conference Champions.</strong></p>
  <p><a href="crschamps.html" >Regular Season Conference Champions (2013-2014 season)</a></p>
 <p><strong>So what teams SHOULD have got into the NCAA Tournament?  And what teams SHOULD NOT HAVE made it to the NCAA Tournament?</strong></p>
  <p><a href="shouldnot.html" >Teams who should not be in the NCAA Tournament</a></p>
   <p><a href="should.html" >Teams who should be in the NCAA Tournament </a></p>
      <p> <strong>Now, let's look at the overall win-loss records of teams who didn't make the NCAA Tournament: </strong></p>

    <p> <strong>Southern Mississippi</strong> had an overall record of 27 wins and 6 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Toledo</strong> had an overall record of 27 wins and 6 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Green Bay</strong> had an overall record of 24 wins and 6 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Louisiana Tech</strong> had an overall record of 27 wins and 7 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Georgia State</strong> had an overall record of 25 wins and 8 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Belmont</strong> had an overall record of 24 wins and 9 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Middle Tennessee</strong> had an overall record of 24 wins and 9 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Southern Methodist University (SMU)</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 9 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Princeton</strong> had an overall record of 20 wins and 8 losses.</p> <p> <strong>IPFW</strong> had an overall record of 24 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Boston University</strong> had an overall record of 24 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>UC Santa Barbara</strong> had an overall record of 21 wins and 9 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Stony Brook</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>UTEP</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Indiana State</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Sam Houston State</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Towson</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Vermont</strong> had an overall record of 22 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Iona</strong> had an overall record of 22 wins and 10 losses.</p> <p> <strong>Ohio</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 11 losses.</p> <p> <strong>UC Irvine</strong> had an overall record of 23 wins and 11 losses.</p> 
     <p>The teams listed above are the same teams that are listed below.  What I am trying to do below, is to make a case for a handful of "bubble teams" that deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament (although none of the teams actually made the NCAA Tournament).  I determined that some of the teams actually <strong>SHOULD</strong> have been in the NCAA Tournament because of their overall winning percentage, while other teams had good overall winning percentages but they just simply didn't win enough games and lost too many games (they just weren't <strong>"good enough"</strong>).  The teams listed below are in alphabetical order (A-Z) by school name.</p>

    <p><strong>Why should I even bother to watch the NCAA Tournament?</strong>  The NCAA Tournament is exciting and there are upsets every year.  However, the selection committee sometimes ranks the team with the worse winning percentage higher than the team with a better overall winning percentage.</p>
