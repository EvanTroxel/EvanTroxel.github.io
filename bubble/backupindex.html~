  <h1>Analyzing the "Bubble Teams" of the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament (2013-2014 season).</h1>
<p>Before you look farther at this webpage, I have an obsession with the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament every year.  It's not just who plays who and who gets this or that ranking.  It's basically everything!  The NCAA Selection Committe puts Spokane, Washington as part of the East Region for a second and third round game!  Spokane is west...or north!  Spokane is definitely not in the east part of the United States!</p>
 <p>Wichita State (34 Wins, 0 Losses) is the <strong>first team</strong> since UNLV in <strong>1991</strong> to go into the tournament undefeated.  Tournament Champions North Carolina Central University (MEAC) and Cal Poly (Big West) are making their first NCAA Division 1 Tournament appearance.  For the second time since 1973, no teams from the state of Indiana are in the tournament.</p>
<p>The winning percentages shown in the chart below are of teams who did not make it into the 2013-14 NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament.  If the 2013-14 NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament was solely based on top 64 or top 68 teams winning percentages, some of these teams would have gotten into the 2013-14 NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament.</p>

    <p><strong>Why does overall record matter?</strong>  Overall record matters because to a degree it does say a lot about how good or bad of a team you are.  In some ways, overall record probably could be seen as an average record.</p>
    <p><strong>Why does conference record matter?</strong>  Conference record matters because if your team is winning many games against a tough opponent, it means your team is at least a good team.  Scoring lots on offense and not giving up a lot of points on defense is a sign of a good (maybe even a great team).</p>
    <p><strong>Conference Tournament Champions 2014:</strong> </p>
    <p> {% for row in Teams %}
    {% if row.Team5 %}
    <strong>{{ row.Team5 }}</strong> is the 2014 {{ row.ConfChamps5 }} Conference Tournament Champions.  They are making their {{ row.Appearance5 }} appearance in the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament.  The last time they made the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament was in the year {{ row.Lastbid5|int }}.</p>
    {% else %}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}</p>  
    
    <p> <strong>Overall win-loss records of teams who didn't make the NCAA Tournament: </strong></p>

    {% for row in Teams %}{% if row.Team1 %}<p> <strong>{{ row.Team1 }}</strong> had an overall record of {{ row.Wins1|int }} wins and {{ row.Losses1|int }} losses.</p> {% else %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
   

   
   
    <p><strong>Teams who got into the NCAA Tournament who deserve to be in the Tournament (top winning percentages solely based on overall record):</strong></p> <p>{% for row in Teams %} {% if row.Team2 %}  {{ row.Team2 }} has  {{ row.Wins2|int }} Wins and {{ row.Losses2|int }} Losses.</p>{% else %}{% endif %}{% endfor %} 

<p><strong>So what teams SHOULD have got into the NCAA Tournament?  And what teams SHOULD NOT HAVE made it to the NCAA Tournament?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHOULD:</strong> Why?  Good enough overall winning percentage.</p>
<p>{% for row in Teams %} {% if row.Team12 %} <strong>{{ row.Team12 }}</strong> <p>Case: {{ row.Case1 }}</p></p>{% else %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
<p><strong>SHOULD NOT HAVE:</strong> Why?  Not good enough overall winning percentage.</p>
<p>{% for row in Teams %} {% if row.Team13 %} {{ row.Team13 }}</p>{% else %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    <p><strong>To be objective, this is every team who I think should be in this year's NCAA Tournament.</strong> The teams listed below are teams who got an automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament by winning their conference tournament championship (32 teams) or they got in because of their winning percentage was among the Top 36 remaining teams eligible to get into the Tournament who didn't already qualify for the Tournament.</p> <p>{% for row in Teams %} {% if row.Team6 %} {{ row.Team6 }} has {{ row.Wins6|int }} wins and {{ row.Losses6|int }} losses.</p>{% else %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    <p>*UTEP, Indiana State, Sam Houston State, Dayton, and Towson had the same winning percentage as Stony Brook and Texas, but Stony Brook and Texas were ranked higher so they get into the Tournament and UTEP, Indiana State, Sam Houston State, Dayton, and Towson are the first five who don't get into the Tournament.</p>
    <p><strong>Why should I even bother to watch the NCAA Tournament?</strong>  The NCAA Tournament is exciting and there are upsets every year.  However, the selection committee sometimes ranks the team with the worse winning percentage higher than the team with a better overall winning percentage.</p>
