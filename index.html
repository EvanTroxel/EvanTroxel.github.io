<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my personal website!</h3>
<p>I hope to update this website as much/often as I can.  The goal is to post stuff on this website on a consistent basis whether that be once a day, once a week, or every two or three weeks.  This website will probably have major upgrades (updates) seasonally (once every 3 months) or at least once during Fall Semester, Winter Break, Spring Semester, and Summer Break.</p>
<h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I'm seeking an internship/job</h3>
<p>I hope to get an internship this summer (2014).  I can read, write, and spell correctly.  I have some radio broadcast experience and can take pictures and shoot video.  I like sports (especially baseball) and am open to listening/hearing about internship/job opportunities.  I am also open to possibly taking internship/job opportunities that are affiliated with advertising and public relations and/or the political world.  So if the words "broadcasting," "journalism" and "mass communications" mean anything to you, then you probably should click on and look at the link that says "Resume" below and then contact me.  </p>

<h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Special Stuff</h3>
<p>The link below titled "Special" will basically be my random thoughts about various things that I deem important, interesting or special.  I also plan to show photos, images, graphs, or graphics that are funny and make me (and hopefully you) feel content and happy about life.  The point of this link is to be uncontroversial, help people to understand my interests, and also is something that I believe everyone will enjoy.</a>
